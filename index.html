`Dear Mayor [Last Name],

We are writing to express deep concern about the increasingly unaffordable cost of essential utilities in our community — specifically water and sewage services.

Monthly sewage charges have risen to over $100, while the base water rate is $68. When combined with taxes, service fees, and other surcharges, residents are paying a minimum of $200 every month just to meet basic sanitation needs. This is creating significant financial hardship for many households.

Access to clean water and safe sewage disposal is a fundamental necessity, not a luxury. We are asking your office to urgently review the current rate structure and explore immediate steps to provide relief for residents — whether through subsidies, billing reform, or infrastructure investments that reduce cost over time.

We appreciate your attention to this matter and urge you to act swiftly on behalf of the citizens you serve.

Sincerely,
${name}
Concerned Resident of [City Name]`
